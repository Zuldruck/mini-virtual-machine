# mini-virtual-machine

The goal of this project is to create a simple virtual machine that is able to interpret programs that are written in a simplified assembler language.

To be precise, it consists in a stack machine that is able to calculate simple arithmetical expressions.

These very arithmetical expressions are given to the machine in the form of simple assembler programs.

## Instructions

- **comments**

They begin with a semicolon (;) and end at the end of a line. A comment may be indifferent at the beginning of a line or after an instruction.

- **push v**

Stack the v value at the top. The v value will naturally take one of the following forms: int8(n), int16(n), int32(n), float(z),  double(z) or bigdecimal(z).
(For example : int16(n) - create an signed 16-bit integer with the value n)

- **pop**

Unstacks the value at the top of the stack.

- **clear**

Clears the stack. Rendering it empty.

- **dup**

Duplicates the value on the top of the stack, and stacks the copy of the value.

- **swap**

Reverses the order of (swaps) the top two values on the stack.

- **dump**

Display each value on the stack from the newest to the oldest, without modifying the stack.
Each value is separated from the next with a line break.

- **assert v**

Verify that the value at the top of the stack is equal to the one passed as parameter in this instruction.
If itâ€™s not the case, the program execution stops and send an error.
The v value, of course, has the same form as those passed as parameter during the push instruction.

- **add**

Unstack the first two values in the stack, add them, and then stack the result.

- **sub**

Unstack the first two values in the stack, substract them, and then stack the result.

- **mul**

Unstack the first two values in the stack, multiply them, and then stack the result.

- **div**

Unstack the first two values in the stack, divide them, and then stack the result. 

- **mod**

Unstack the first two values in the stack, calculate their modulo, and then stack the result.

- **load v**

Copy the value from the register v and stack it at the top.

- **store v**

Unstack the first value and store it to the register v.

- **print**

Interpret it like an ASCII value and display the corresponding character on the standard output.

- **exit**

Quit the program execution that is underway.
